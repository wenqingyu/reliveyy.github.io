```swift
// Do not need import CoreFoundation
var gb18030 = 
    CFStringConvertEncodingToNSStringEncoding(
        CFStringConvertIANACharSetNameToEncoding("GB18030")
    )
// GBK and GB2312 are also available 
var str = NSString(data: myData, encoding: gb18030)!
```

### GB2312, GBK, GB18030
GB abbreviates Guojia Biaozhun (国家标准), which means national standard in the People's Republic of China. The relationship between the three encodings can be simply considered as GB2312 included in GBK and GBK included in GB18030. So using GB18030 is the best way when comes up with Chinese characters' raw bytes need to be converted to UTF-8. In Cocoa framework, there is no NSGB18030StringEncoding like NSUTF8StringEncoding which we can use out of the box. However in CoreFoundation framework, CFString defines a lot of external string encodings including GB18030. You can reference these encodings from [the official document](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/CoreFoundation/Reference/CFStringRef/index.html#//apple_ref/c/func/CFStringConvertIANACharSetNameToEncoding).
